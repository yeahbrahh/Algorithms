def bfs(graph, start):

    # Tips
    # This assignment is really just implementing Algorithm 14.4.1 from the textbook with two small
    # wrinkles:
    # •  You need a structure for marking which vertices are explored(see injunction not to mark
    #                                                                 up  the  graph  above)
    # •  Rather  than  creating  multiple  lists  Li you  are  to  structure  them as tuples in a  list  of
    # tuples and return that  list.
